# CarSalesAnalysis
Project Overview:
The Car Sales Data Analysis project aims to create a personal portfolio showcasing data analysis and visualizations based on car sales data. The project utilizes SQL Server queries to generate relevant data for visualization purposes, which are then visualized using Tableau. The portfolio will provide a visually appealing and informative representation of car sales trends, insights, and key findings.

Project Goals:

Collect a comprehensive dataset of car sales data using Kaggle, including information such as car make, model, year, sales volume, pricing, and other relevant attributes. Clean the dataset to ensure data quality and consistency.

Apply various data analysis techniques to uncover meaningful insights and trends within the car sales data. Explore factors such as sales performance by car make and model, regional sales patterns and customer preferences.

Utilize Tableau to create visually appealing and interactive visualizations that effectively communicate the analyzed car sales data. Develop charts, graphs, and dashboards to showcase key findings and trends in an intuitive and engaging manner.

Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface within Tableau to navigate through the car sales visualizations. Allow users to interact with the visualizations, explore specific car models or time periods, and gain insights into the data.
